Conditioned Profile
================-==

The project is built in two parts:

- **cp-creator** a script to create a Firefox "heavy" profile
- **cp-archiver** a script to create a collection of tar-gzipped files


cp-creator
----------

The tool maintains a local profile using Arsenic & Geckodriver,
it visits random pages using a dictionary of words.

To run it, just point the profile directory::

    $ cp-creator /tmp/profile --max-urls 10
    Updating profile located at '/tmp/profile'

    Done.

If the profile does not exists, it will generate a new one.

The profile also gets the latest Firefox Nightly and uses it
automatically.


cp-archiver
-----------

Once the local profile has been created, **cp-archiver** can
generate a ZIP file that can be downloaded by clients.

**cp-archiver** takes two arguments to run:

- the **profile** directory
- the **archives** directory

The **archives** directory is populated by the script with
tar-gzipped archives of the profiles. It contains up to ten
10 versions of the heavy profile, named with this pattern:

- YYYY-MM-DD-hp.tar.gz
- YYYY-MM-DD-hp.tar.gz.sha256 <== checksum
- latest.tar.gz

Where latest.tar.gz is a symbolic link to the latest version.

The archive contains an embedded GPG signature for verifying the
origin and authenticity of the profile if needed.

In order to speed up downloads, the tool also produces
tar-gzipped diffs so the client can update its local version without
having to download the whole archive everytime.

Diff files are using this naming pattern:

- diff-YYYY-MM-DD-YYYY-MM-DD-hp.tar.gz
- diff-YYYY-MM-DD-YYYY-MM-DD-hp.tar.gz.sha256

Where the first date is the oldest version.

The archives directory is published as a browsable HTTP directory.


Example::

    $ cp-archiver /tmp/profile /tmp/archives/
    Creating 2017-08-31-hp.tar.gz...
    => Adding /tmp/profile/addonStartup.json.lz4...
    ...
    => Adding /tmp/profile/xulstore.json...
    Done.
    Creating a diff tarball with the previous day
    => 6183 new files, 255 modified, 5 deleted.
    Done.
